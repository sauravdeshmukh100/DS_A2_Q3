Here’s a detailed breakdown of what you need to do for 3.1 (System Components) and 3.2 (Secure Authentication, Authorization, and Logging):
3.1 System Components

The system consists of three main entities:
1. Client (User)

    Registers an account with the payment gateway.
    Logs in to authenticate and receive an authorization token.
    Requests transactions (e.g., sending money, checking balance).
    Communicates with the Payment Gateway via gRPC.

2. Payment Gateway

    Acts as an intermediary between the Client and Bank Servers.
    Handles user registration, authentication, authorization, and transaction processing.
    Maintains a record of registered users and authentication tokens.
    Communicates with Bank Servers via gRPC to execute transactions.

3. Bank Server

    Manages bank accounts and their balances.
    Validates transactions and updates balances.
    Responds to balance inquiries and payment requests from the Payment Gateway.
    Uses in-memory data structures for faster processing and stores account details in a persistent file (JSON/DB).

3.2 Secure Authentication, Authorization, and Logging
A. Data Storage & Data Structures

    Client Registration Data (Stored in a JSON file)
        Structure:

    {
      "username": {
        "password": "hashed_password",
        "bank_name": "Bank1",
        "account_number": "1234567890"
      }
    }

    Use Python dictionaries (hash maps) in-memory for fast lookups.
    Store user passwords in hashed format (bcrypt or SHA-256).

Bank Account Data (Stored in a JSON or database)

    Structure:

    {
      "account_number": {
        "balance": 5000.75
      }
    }

    Use Python dictionaries for account balances (faster retrieval).
    Persist changes in JSON or SQLite.

Transaction Logs (Stored in a log file)

    Each transaction request should be logged with:

    Timestamp, Username, From_Account, To_Account, Amount, Status (Success/Fail), Reason (if failed)

    Use text-based logging (log file) or structured logs (JSON).

Authentication Tokens (Stored in memory and periodically persisted in a file)

    Structure:

        {
          "username": "valid-token-abc123"
        }

        Use a dictionary for fast lookups.

B. Flow of Processes
1. User Registration Process

Client → Payment Gateway

    The client sends a registration request with:
        username
        password
        bank_name
        account_number
    The Payment Gateway checks if the username already exists.
    If the username is unique:
        Hashes the password.
        Stores user details in a JSON file.
        Responds with "Registration Successful".
    If the username exists, responds with "User already exists".

2. User Login Process

Client → Payment Gateway

    The client sends a login request with:
        username
        password
    The Payment Gateway:
        Verifies the credentials.
        If valid, generates an authentication token.
        Stores the token in memory and optionally persists it in a file.
        Sends the token to the client.
    If invalid, responds with "Invalid credentials".

3. Processing a Payment

Client → Payment Gateway → Bank Server

    The client sends a payment request with:
        auth_token
        from_account
        to_account
        amount
    The Payment Gateway:
        Verifies the auth_token.
        Checks if the sender has an account.
        Contacts the Bank Server via gRPC with transaction details.
    The Bank Server:
        Checks if the from_account has sufficient balance.
        If yes, deducts the amount from from_account and adds it to to_account.
        Responds with "Transaction Successful".
        If insufficient balance, responds with "Transaction Failed - Insufficient Funds".
    The Payment Gateway forwards the response to the client.
    The Payment Gateway logs the transaction.

4. Checking Account Balance

Client → Payment Gateway → Bank Server

    The client sends a balance request with:
        auth_token
        account_number
    The Payment Gateway verifies the auth_token.
    It forwards the request to the Bank Server.
    The Bank Server:
        Looks up the account balance.
        Returns it to the Payment Gateway.
    The Payment Gateway sends the balance to the client.

C. Security Implementation

    Authentication
        Uses password-based authentication.
        Passwords are hashed before storage.
        Generates session tokens upon successful login.

    Authorization
        Every request must include a valid authentication token.
        Tokens are stored in memory (with a timeout mechanism).

    Logging
        All transactions and login attempts are logged.
        Stores logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON or log files).

D. Error Handling & Edge Cases
Scenario	Expected Behavior
Duplicate username during registration	Return "User already exists"
Wrong password during login	Return "Invalid credentials"
Invalid token in payment request	Return "Unauthorized"
Insufficient funds	Return "Transaction Failed - Insufficient Funds"
Invalid account number in transaction	Return "Invalid Account"
Summary of Data Structures & Storage
Component	Data Structure	Storage Type
User Credentials	Dictionary {username: {password, bank_name, account_number}}	JSON file
Authentication Tokens	Dictionary {username: token}	Memory & file
Bank Accounts	Dictionary {account_number: balance}	JSON or DB
Transactions Log	List of transactions {timestamp, from, to, amount, status}	Log file
Final Steps

    Define gRPC Protobuf files to implement communication between entities.
    Implement Payment Gateway to handle authentication, authorization, and transactions.
    Implement Bank Server to manage accounts and process transactions.
    Ensure security with password hashing, authentication tokens, and logging.
    Test with multiple clients to verify security, logging, and transactions.

ðŸ”¹ Why Do You Need SSL/TLS Even with JWT?

ðŸ”´ Without SSL/TLS:

    JWT tokens are sent as plain text â†’ Can be stolen & reused (Session Hijacking).
    Account details (e.g., usernames, balances, transactions) are exposed on the network.
    Attackers can modify transactions before they reach the server.

ðŸŸ¢ With SSL/TLS:

    All gRPC messages (including JWT tokens) are encrypted âœ…
    Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks are prevented âœ…
    Data integrity is ensured (no modification during transmission) âœ…


    I am assuming the encrytption of same token can be differnet when encrypted again and again 


    ðŸ”¹ Will the Encryption of the Same Token Be Different Each Time?

âœ… Yes! The encryption of the same token will be different each time in SSL/TLS.
